This project allows you to define a project in text using YAML files and generate IDE project files
based on the rules defined in records. No one should ever commit IDE specific project file to a repository again!

The project is in alpha phase. Check issues for the ongoing tasks or todo tasks.

Project generator currently generaters projects for the following tools (IDE, Makefile, etc..):

 - uVision4 and uVision5
 - IAR
 - Makefile (GCC ARM)
 - Makefile (ARMCC)
 - Cmake (GCC ARM)
 - CoIDE (GCC ARM)
 - Eclipse (Makefile with GCC ARM)
 - Sublime (Makefile with GCC ARM)
 - Visual studio (Makefile with GCC ARM)

We appreciate any help and you are more than welcome to send a pull request or create a new issue in this repository.
The plan is to support as many IDE as possible , same applies for targets/MCU.
